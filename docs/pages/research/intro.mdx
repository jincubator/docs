## High Performance Solving, Arbitrage and Market Making Infrastructure Research

This knowledge base and learning center is based upon research done around solving, arbitrage and market making infrastructure. It includes design patters for No Liquidity Solving for intent based systems.

Previous work includes bridging, zero knowledge and chain consensus and signing.

The majority of this research was done by [John Whitton](https://johnwhitton.com).

**John would like to thank**

- [Propellor Heads](https://www.propellerheads.xyz/): For their outstanding work on indexing, simulation and execution for Solvers as part of [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview) which lays the foundation for the jincubator platform.
- [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview): For their leading work on [Uniswap V4 Hook Architecture](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hooks) and their inspirational design of [CompactX](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) including resource locking via [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact) and attestations via [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signing implemented in [Tribunal](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal).
- [1inch](https://1inch.io/): For their work on the [limit-order-protocol](https://portal.1inch.dev/documentation/contracts/limit-order-protocol/limit-order-introduction) and support in [unite-defi](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/defiunite-jincubator-g1h0p) and advice on the design of [No Liquidity Solving](/research/solving/tycho1inchNOL) which integrates Tycho Solvers with 1inch without needing to provide up front liquidity.
- [Atrium Academy](https://atrium.academy/uniswap): For their Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator and the mentors Haardik and Saucepoint.
- [eco](https://eco.com): Where I was fortunate enough to lead the engineering team and work on hard problems around Cross L2 Transactions and designing and building a dedicated roll up.
- [Aaron Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronqli/): who has mentored and driven much of the research around cryptographic primitives, wallets, gaming and trustless bridging.
- [The Delendum Team](https://delendum.xyz/team): who are leading many zero knowledge research initiatives.
- [Ganesha Upadhyaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/): For his leading work on the horizon bridge and other trustless bridging research.
- [Rongjian Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongjianlan/): For his work on core protocol, specifically Harmony and the knowledge which he generously shared.
