# Research Proposal: Solvers, Arbitrage & Intent-Based Protocols

## Background

Over the past eight months, I’ve developed both a solver engine and an intent-based swap protocol integrating Uniswap v4. My work spans arbitrage detection/execution, real-time streaming, solver frameworks, and resource-efficient intent mechanisms. Current implementations and documentation are accessible via [jincubator.com/research](https://www.jincubator.com/research).

## Proposal Scope

The aim of this research is twofold: deepen the integration of solver-driven arbitrage with Tycho’s ecosystem, and extend the protocol footprint to Uniswap v4 and beyond.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Tycho Streaming & Simulation**  
  Integrate Tycho’s streaming for real-time arbitrage opportunity intake, and Tycho’s simulation for stress-testing and MEV strategy modeling.

- **Arbitrage Landscape Mapping**  
  Use Tycho-enabled simulations, dynamic graph construction, and routing algorithms to map multi-chain arbitrage opportunities across Ethereum, Base, and Unichain.

- **Flash Loan Arbitrage Best Practices**  
  Develop standardized, gas-efficient, risk-mitigated solver strategies for flash-loan driven arbitrage.

- **Uniswap v4 Booster Pools**  
  Design and prototype “after-swap self-arbitrage” hooks that both optimize swap execution and act as built-in liquidity boosters within v4 pools.

## Why Me?

I am exceptionally well-positioned to lead this research based on:

- **Successful Solver & Protocol Development**  
  Built a modular, real-time arbitrage solver system integrating Bellman-Ford cycle detection, fixed-point math, and flash-loan execution logic.

- **Uniswap v4 Protocol & Intent Integration**  
  Architected an intent-based swap protocol built on Uniswap v4, with experience in **hook development**, **ERC-6909 resource management** (based on _the-compact_), and **1-inch routing integration**.  
  This work demonstrates both technical feasibility and architectural insight into scalable solver systems. A detailed overview of this **opinionated architecture** can be found here: [Research: Solving Architecture](https://www.jincubator.com/research/solving/architecture).

- **Deep Research & Engineering Expertise**  
  With a background as a research engineer, I’ve delivered DeFi infrastructure, academic-grade research, and production systems. My experience extends to zero-knowledge primitives, consensus research, and cross-chain bridging ([johnwhitton.com](https://johnwhitton.com/about)).

- **Proven Technical Leadership**  
  As a former Engineering Manager, Ecosystem Architect, and CTO, I have led and scaled engineering teams, driven multi-team projects, and guided ecosystem initiatives across companies such as Harmony, Eco, and Loyyal ([johnwhitton.com](https://johnwhitton.com/resume)).

## Proposed Collaboration

Simultaneously with the research, I propose extending the existing solver repository to include **Uniswap v4 hook integration** aligned with Tycho’s upcoming v4 release—delivering strategic alignment and practical proof-of-concept.

## Outcomes

The deliverables will include:

1. A research framework combining Tycho’s tools with intent-based arbitrage strategy.
2. A functional Uniswap v4 hook integrated solver, illustrating real-world capability.
3. A reference architecture for multi-chain, MEV-aware solver infrastructure.

This research will enrich Tycho’s ecosystem and serve as a clear, professional introduction to key stakeholders like Gauntlet, FlashBots, Paradigm, and other arbitrage-focused entities.
