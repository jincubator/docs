# Proposals

Welcome to the Jincubator Research Hub.

Our work focuses on **solvers, arbitrage, and intent-based protocols** â€” combining deep research with practical engineering to advance DeFi infrastructure. Current projects include:

- A modular **arbitrage solver framework** for real-time detection and execution across chains (Ethereum, Base, Unichain).
- An **intent-based swap protocol** on **Uniswap v4**, featuring hook development, ERC-6909 resource management (based on _the-compact_), and integration with 1inch routing.
- Research on **Tycho Streaming & Simulation**, flash loan arbitrage best practices, and novel mechanisms such as **Uniswap v4 booster pools** with after-swap self-arbitrage.
- Development of an **opinionated solver architecture** for scalable, MEV-aware execution.

Previously, we have also participated in hackathons and submitted multiple grant proposals, which provided the foundation for this ongoing research and engineering work.
