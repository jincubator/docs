# Strategies

## Overview

Strategies define the approach and methodology used to solve different types of intents and trading problems. The system implements a flexible strategy framework that enables market makers and solvers to deploy sophisticated trading algorithms with real-time profitability analysis and execution.

## Using our Solution

Our strategy framework enables:

- **Cyclical Arbitrage**: Capital-efficient arbitrage using flash loans with no upfront capital
- **Multi-hop Optimization**: 2-5 hop routes with analytical optimization for maximum profitability
- **Real-time Execution**: Strategies that can process over 1,000 routes per second
- **Intent-based Solving**: Support for UniswapX, CowSwap, and 1inch intent-based protocols
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and success rate tracking

## Solution Overview

The strategy architecture follows the principle: **Collectors → Strategies → Execution** with modular components that can be combined for different trading approaches.

### Strategy Types

#### Cyclical Arbitrage (CARB)
The first and primary strategy implemented is cyclical arbitrage - starting and ending with the same token, traversing through routes to simulate each input and output amount, evaluating if a positive arbitrage exists.

#### Token-based Arbitrage (TOKEN)
An advanced strategy that addresses execution efficiency and risk management by grouping routes by input token:

**Key Features:**
- **Route Grouping**: All routes sharing the same input token are grouped together
- **Best Route Selection**: Only the highest profit route per token group is executed
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Eliminates multiple executions for the same underlying opportunity
- **Forced Execution Mode**: Supports execution of even negative profit routes for testing/validation

**Implementation Logic:**
```rust
// Filter routes containing target token anywhere in path
routes.into_iter()
    .filter(|route| route.path.contains(&target_token_bytes))
    .collect()
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Retrieve affected routes for pool's tokens
2. Group routes by input token
3. Evaluate all routes in each group
4. Select highest profit route per group
5. Execute only selected routes (with optional forced execution)

### Architecture Components

#### Route Evaluation for Profitability
The RouteAnalyzer component uses real-time protocol states to calculate accurate swap amounts and profitability metrics:

```rust
impl RouteAnalyzer {
    pub async fn evaluate_route(
        &self,
        route: &Route,
        pool_store: &dyn PoolStore,
    ) -> Result<RouteEvaluation> {
        // Get current pool states
        let pool_states = pool_store.get_pool_states(&route.pools).await?;

        // Calculate optimal input amount
        let optimal_amount = self.find_optimal_input_amount(route, &pool_states).await?;

        // Calculate profitability
        let profit = self.calculate_profitability(route, &protected_amounts).await?;

        Ok(RouteEvaluation {
            execution_viable: profit.net_profit > 0.0,
            // ... other fields
        })
    }
}
```

#### Signal Generation
The system generates execution signals for profitable routes with comprehensive tracking:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct RouteSignal {
    pub route_id: String,
    pub route: MinimalRoute,
    pub evaluation: RouteEvaluation,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub execution_attempts: u32,
    pub priority_score: f64,
    pub status: SignalStatus,
}
```

## Technical Reference

### Cyclical Arbitrage Strategy

The cyclical arbitrage strategy implements sophisticated route evaluation algorithms that analyze potential arbitrage opportunities across multiple DEX protocols.

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm Application

The route evaluation process leverages the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect negative-weight cycles that correspond to profitable arbitrage opportunities:

```
d(v) = min_{(u,v) in E} [ d(u) + w(u,v) ]
```

Negative-weight cycles represent opportunities where the sequence of swaps results in a net gain after accounting for fees.

#### Optimal Amount Calculation

The system uses a sophisticated **exponential search + binary search** algorithm:

##### Phase 1: Doubling Search (Exponential Growth)
**Goal**: Quickly find an upper bound for profitable input.

1. Set `A = A_min`
2. Repeat for maximum iterations:
   - Evaluate profit: `P = profit(A)`
   - If `P > P_best`, update best values
   - If profit drops below threshold, stop doubling
   - Else, double the input: `A = 2 * A`

##### Phase 2: Binary Search (Refinement)
**Goal**: Refine the optimal input within `[A_min, A_max]`.

1. While `A_max - A_min > ε` and iterations < max:
   - Compute midpoint: `A_mid = (A_min + A_max) / 2`
   - Evaluate profit at midpoint
   - Update best if midpoint is better
   - Update bounds based on profit comparison

**Mathematical Summary**:
```
maximize P(A) = profit from route given input A
subject to A_min ≤ A ≤ A_max, P(A) ≥ profit_threshold
where A_max found via exponential doubling and A_best refined via binary search.
```

### Flash Loan Integration

Strategies leverage flash loan integration for capital-efficient execution:

#### Flash Loan Selection Logic
1. **V3 Flash Loans**: Always compatible with any route (30 bps fee)
2. **V4 Flash Loans**: Only compatible with routes that do NOT contain V4 pools (0 bps fee)
3. **Priority Order**: V3 (priority 1), V4 (priority 2)
4. **Liquidity Requirements**: Minimum liquidity thresholds based on strategy requirements

#### Sequential Swap Execution
Multi-hop swaps are executed atomically through flash loans:

1. **Flash Loan Borrow**: Borrow required tokens from selected pool
2. **Sequential Swaps**: Execute swaps in sequence through route
3. **Flash Loan Repay**: Repay borrowed tokens with profit
4. **Profit Capture**: Keep remaining profit after repayment

### Profitability Metrics

#### Mathematical Formulas

##### Swap Profit Percentage
```
swap_profit_percentage = ((amount_out - amount_in) / amount_in) * 100
```

##### Flash Fee Percentage
```
flash_fee_pct = (flash_loan_fee / amount_in) * 100
```

##### Net Profit Percentage
```
net_profit_percentage = swap_profit_percentage - flash_fee_pct - gas_cost_pct
```

##### Net Profit in Token Units
```
net_profit_token = amount_out - amount_in - flash_loan_fee - gas_cost_token
```

⚙️ Protocols: [uniswap_v3 -> uniswap_v2 -> uniswap_v2]
```

### Strategy Framework

#### Queue Management
The system uses priority-based queue management for strategy execution:

```rust
fn calculate_priority(&self, route: &MinimalRoute, evaluation: &RouteEvaluation) -> f64 {
    // Higher profit = higher priority
    let profit_score = evaluation.net_profit_percentage;

    // Shorter routes = higher priority (less gas)
    let gas_score = 1.0 / (route.hops as f64 + 1.0);

    // Combine scores
    profit_score * 0.7 + gas_score * 0.3
}
```

#### Signal Status Flow
1. **Route Discovery** → Create RouteSignal
2. **Evaluation Phase** → Check profitability
3. **Execution Phase** → Execute if profitable
4. **Result Processing** → Update signal status
