# Solver System Design Document - Phase 0.2

## Abstract

Phase 0.2 represents the critical transition from pure arbitrage to intent-based solving, introducing the foundational infrastructure for multi-protocol intent resolution. This release establishes the SOLO (Solve Optimal) optimization engine, implements comprehensive Ethereum support with MEV protection, and creates the foundation for solver ecosystem expansion through API services and centralized vault infrastructure.
