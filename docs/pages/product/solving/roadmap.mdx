# Solver Evolution Roadmap: 0.2 to 2.0

## Abstract

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the solver system from the current 0.1 arbitrage-focused implementation to a comprehensive intent-based solving platform. The roadmap spans from Q4 2024 through Q2 2025, transitioning from single-purpose arbitrage to multi-protocol intent solving across chains.

## Overview

Building on the foundation of the 0.1 Release, this roadmap charts the path toward a mature intent-based solving ecosystem. The evolution focuses on expanding from cyclical arbitrage to comprehensive intent solving across major protocols including UniswapX, CowSwap, and 1inch.
