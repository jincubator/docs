## Data Flow

### Real-Time Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Tycho streaming APIs provide real-time pool state updates
2. **Graph Building**: Pool data transformed into arbitrage graphs
3. **Route Detection**: Bellman-Ford algorithm finds profitable cycles
4. **Route Evaluation**: Optimal amounts calculated and profitability assessed
5. **Strategy Selection**: CARB or TOKEN strategy determines execution logic
6. **Blacklist Filtering**: Failed routes filtered out before execution
7. **Execution**: Flash loan transactions constructed and submitted
8. **Persistence**: Results stored in RocksDB for analysis

### Performance Metrics

- **Graph Update**: ~191µs for 38 new pools
- **Route Calculations**: Microsecond-level performance per hop
- **Route Evaluation**: ~15µs for evaluation phase
- **Database Operations**: >10,000 operations/second
- **Memory Usage**: Less than 2GB for 100,000 pools

## Token-Based Strategy System

### Overview

The TOKEN strategy addresses two critical issues:
1. **Duplicate Execution Risk**: Multiple routes executing for same opportunity
2. **Repeated Failing Transactions**: Same failed routes being retried

### Strategy Model

#### CARB Strategy (Existing)
- Evaluates all profitable routes
- Multiple executions possible per cycle
- Traditional arbitrage approach

#### TOKEN Strategy (New)
- Groups routes by input token
- Executes only best route per token group
- Forced execution even if negative profit
- Detailed profit logging with sorting

### Implementation Requirements

#### Token Evaluation Flow
1. Retrieve affected routes for pool's tokens
2. Group routes by input token
3. Evaluate all routes in each group
4. Select highest profit route per group
5. Execute only selected routes (forced execution)

#### Route Filtering Logic
```rust
// Filter routes containing target token anywhere in path
routes.into_iter()
    .filter(|route| route.path.contains(&target_token_bytes))
    .collect()
```

#### Execution Logic
- Only one route executed per token group
- Even negative profit routes executed (for testing)
- Detailed logging of selection process
- Profit comparison within groups

## Route Blacklisting & Management

### Blacklist System

Routes are automatically blacklisted on:

1. **Pre-flight Simulation Failures**
   - Empty route paths
   - Missing encoded solutions
   - Missing flash loan data
   - Invalid protocols
   - Empty flash loan tokens
   - Empty component pool IDs

2. **Transaction Validation Failures**
   - Route validation errors
   - Protocol compatibility issues
   - Flash loan validation failures

### Blacklist Configuration

```toml
# routes.toml
[base]
blacklisted_routes = []

[ethereum]
blacklisted_routes = []

[unichain]
blacklisted_routes = []
```

### Filtering Hierarchy

1. **pools.toml** → blacklisted pools
2. **tokens.toml** → blacklisted tokens (routes containing token)
3. **routes.toml** → blacklisted routes

### Automatic Blacklisting

- Routes added immediately on preflight failures
- Persisted to `routes.toml` automatically
- Manual review required for reinstatement (Phase 1)
- Future: Error type differentiation (temporary vs permanent)

### Important Note

**Post-flight transaction reverts are NOT automatically blacklisted** - only logged to `profit.txt`. This prevents blacklisting routes that fail due to temporary conditions (slippage, MEV, etc.).

## Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

### Streaming Architecture

#### Phase 1: Data Ingestion
- **WebSocket Connection**: Direct connection to Tycho indexers
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-second interval processing cycles
- **Multi-chain Support**: Base, Ethereum, Unichain networks
- **Protocol Coverage**: Uniswap V2/V3/V4 support

#### Phase 2: Processing Pipeline
- **Graph Updates**: Incremental graph building with new components
- **Route Calculation**: Multi-hop arbitrage detection (up to 4 hops)
- **State Processing**: Real-time protocol state synchronization
- **Evaluation**: Continuous profit opportunity assessment

#### Phase 3: Execution
- **Strategy Selection**: CARB vs TOKEN strategy routing
- **Blacklist Filtering**: Pre-execution route validation
- **Transaction Building**: Flash loan transaction construction
- **Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking

### Performance Characteristics

- **Pool Coverage**: ~2000 pools (Base chain, 1-500 ETH TVL)
- **Processing Speed**: Sub-millisecond route calculations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Less than 500MB for active streaming
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Throughput**: 100+ blocks/minute processing capability

### Configuration Parameters

```toml
# Example streaming configuration
min_tvl = 1.0          # Minimum TVL in ETH
max_tvl = 500.0        # Maximum TVL in ETH
max_hops = 4           # Maximum route hops
profit_threshold = 0.3  # Minimum profit percentage
block_count = 20       # Blocks to process (0 = unlimited)
```

## Flash Loan Integration

### Flash Loan Providers

1. **Uniswap V3**: Primary provider, 30 bps fee
2. **Uniswap V4**: Supported with overflow protection
3. **Balancer V2**: Supported, 0 bps fee
4. **Aave V3**: Supported, variable fees

### Flash Loan Selection Criteria

- **Pool Type**: Must be `uniswap_v3` pool
- **Token Requirements**: Must contain starting token for route
- **Path Validation**: Flash token must NOT be in route path
- **Fee Optimization**: Lowest fee provider selection

### Route Integration

#### Two-Phase Route Generation
1. **Phase 1**: Find unique route paths (without flash loans)
2. **Phase 2**: Add flash loan information to unique routes

#### Validation Process
- Flash loan pool validation
- Route path compatibility check
- Fee calculation and optimization
- Database persistence (only valid routes stored)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Route Deduplication**: Before expensive flash loan lookups
- **Efficient Selection**: O(1) flash loan pool lookup
- **Memory Management**: Reduced duplicate route creation
- **Database Filtering**: Only routes with valid flash loans persisted

## Performance Optimizations

### In-Memory Route Management

#### O(1) Pool Index Lookup
```rust
// Fast lookup: pool_id -> set of route_ids
route_pool_index: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>>>

// In-memory route storage
routes_in_memory: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, MinimalRoute>>>
```

#### Key Optimizations
- **Database I/O Reduction**: 95% reduction (routes loaded once vs. every update)
- **Route Lookup**: O(1) vs O(n) for affected route identification
- **Incremental Calculation**: Only new routes vs. all routes recalculated
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal overhead with smart indexing

### Batch Processing Optimizations

- **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Adjusts based on dataset size (100/50/20 pools)
- **Early Termination**: Limits large datasets for performance
- **Reduced Processing Delays**: 5ms for large datasets, 10ms for smaller
- **Performance Improvement**: ~80% reduction in processing time

### Graph and Route Persistence

- **WriteBatch Operations**: Efficient batch database operations
- **Keccak256 Deduplication**: Hash-based route deduplication
- **Column Family Management**: Proper CF separation (routes, nodes, edges)
- **Real-time Updates**: Incremental persistence with minimal overhead

## Appendix: Implementation Gaps Analysis

Based on the comprehensive review of the codebase and the retrospective findings, the following gaps have been identified between the current design and actual implementation:

### 1. Architecture Violations & Technical Debt

#### Queue Manager Size Violations
- **Issue**: Several queue managers exceed the 300 LOC limit established in CLAUDE.md
- **Impact**: Business logic leaking into concurrency wrappers
- **Files Affected**:
  - `route_analyzer_queue.rs` (~4000+ LOC)
  - `graph_manager_queue.rs`
- **Resolution Required**: Refactor large queue managers to delegate more logic to underlying managers

#### Forbidden Dependency Violations
- **Issue**: Some components violate the established dependency hierarchy
- **Examples**: Core types depending on CLI components, queue managers calling other queue managers
- **Impact**: Circular dependencies, difficult testing, poor separation of concerns
- **Resolution Required**: Strict enforcement of dependency rules outlined in CLAUDE.md

#### Mixed Concerns in Components
- **Issue**: Persistence logic mixed with traversal logic in some components
- **Impact**: Difficulty in testing, reduced modularity
- **Resolution Required**: Clear separation following single responsibility principle

### 2. Documentation Fragmentation

- **Gap**: Architecture violations not caught until code review
- **Examples Needed**:
  - Size limits on queue managers
  - Dependency hierarchy validation
  - Interface consistency checks
