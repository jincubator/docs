## Known Issues & Active Development

### Critical Issues (P0)

#### 1. Preflight Validation False Positives

**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Bug
**Description**: Preflight simulation passes but transactions revert on-chain
**Root Cause**: `from_balance < amount` errors not caught by `eth_call` simulation
**Impact**: All 16 test transactions reverted despite passing preflight (September 2024)

**Symptoms**:
- `eth_call` simulation returns success
- Transaction submitted to network
- Transaction reverts with balance/amount errors
- No warning or rejection during preflight phase

**Investigation Required**:
1. Simulation uses incorrect block state (latest vs pending)
2. Missing slippage tolerance buffers
3. Flash loan liquidity not verified before execution
4. State changes between simulation and execution not accounted for

**Planned Fix**: See `docs/implementation/refactor.md` Section 3.0.1

---

#### 2. Missing Detailed Logging

**Status**: ⚠️ Incomplete Feature
**Description**: Current logging lacks critical details for debugging and analysis
**Impact**: Difficult to debug route execution and analyze profitability

**Missing Log Categories**:
1. Protocols used per route
2. Full token addresses (not just symbols)
3. Raw amounts in wei format
4. Pool IDs for each hop
5. Flash loan details (pool, token, fee)
6. Input amounts per hop
7. Route path visualization

**Current vs Required**:
```

## Data Flow

### Real-Time Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Tycho streaming APIs provide real-time pool state updates
2. **Graph Building**: Pool data transformed into arbitrage graphs
3. **Route Detection**: Bellman-Ford algorithm finds profitable cycles
4. **Route Evaluation**: Optimal amounts calculated and profitability assessed
5. **Strategy Selection**: CARB or TOKEN strategy determines execution logic
6. **Blacklist Filtering**: Failed routes filtered out before execution
7. **Signal Publishing**: Selected routes published to execution queue via TradeSignal
8. **Execution Job Creation**: TradeSignal converted to ExecutionJob with encoded solution
9. **Queue-Based Execution**: ExecutionJob sent via mpsc::Sender to execution engine
10. **Transaction Building**: Flash loan transactions constructed and submitted
11. **Persistence**: Results stored in RocksDB for analysis

### Signal Publishing and Execution Flow

#### TradeSignal Structure

```rust
pub struct TradeSignal {
    pub signal_id: String,           // Unique signal identifier
    pub route: RouteMinimal,         // The actual route to execute
    pub optimal_input: FixedPoint,   // Calculated optimal input amount
    pub expected_output: FixedPoint, // Expected output amount
    pub expected_profit: FixedPoint, // Expected profit after fees
    // ... other fields
}
```

#### Execution Queue Flow

1. **Route Analyzer** creates TradeSignal from best route selection
2. **Signal Validation** ensures route contains target token (TOKEN strategy)
3. **ExecutionJob Creation** converts TradeSignal to ExecutionJob with:
   - Fresh encoded solution generation (just-in-time)
   - Route validation and consistency checks (with arbitrage cycle support)
   - Permit2 signature preparation
4. **Queue Publishing** sends ExecutionJob via `mpsc::Sender<ExecutionJob>`
5. **Execution Engine** receives job and processes transaction
6. **Transaction Building** creates flash loan transaction with encoded solution
7. **Blockchain Submission** sends transaction to network

### Performance Metrics

- **Graph Update**: ~191µs for 38 new pools
- **Route Calculations**: Microsecond-level performance per hop
- **Route Evaluation**: ~15µs for evaluation phase
- **Database Operations**: >10,000 operations/second
- **Memory Usage**: less than 2GB for 100,000 pools

## Token-Based Strategy System

### Overview

The TOKEN strategy addresses two critical issues:

1. **Duplicate Execution Risk**: Multiple routes executing for same opportunity
2. **Repeated Failing Transactions**: Same failed routes being retried

### Strategy Model

#### CARB Strategy (Existing)

- Evaluates all profitable routes
- Multiple executions possible per cycle
- Traditional arbitrage approach

#### TOKEN Strategy (New)

- Groups routes by input token
- Executes only best route per token group
- Multiple token groups can execute in parallel (streaming mode)
- Single execution for CLI `--token` testing mode
- Detailed profit logging with sorting

### Implementation Requirements

#### Complete TOKEN Strategy Execution Flow (CORRECTED)

1. **State Update Processing**: Tokens are identified from Tycho state updates
2. **Affected Route Calculation**: Routes affected by token state changes are retrieved
3. **Target Token Filtering**: Routes filtered to contain target token anywhere in path
4. **Input Token Grouping**: Filtered routes grouped by input token (first token in path)
5. **Per-Group Route Evaluation**: ALL routes in each token group evaluated for profitability using RouteEvaluator
6. **Profit-Based Selection**: Highest profit route selected per token group using select_best_route_from_token_group_with_details()
7. **TradeSignal Creation**: Selected route converted to TradeSignal with complete evaluation data
8. **Execution Job Creation**: TradeSignal converted to ExecutionJob with encoded solution via create_execution_job()
9. **Queue-Based Execution**: ExecutionJob sent via `mpsc::Sender<ExecutionJob>` to execution engine
10. **Transaction Building**: Execution engine builds and sends blockchain transaction

#### CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Route Selection Method

- **BROKEN METHOD** (caused route mismatch): `TokenBasedRouteEvaluator::select_best_route_from_batch()` - arbitrarily selected first route
- **CORRECT METHOD** (profit-based selection): `select_best_route_from_token_group_with_details()` - evaluates ALL routes and selects highest profit

#### Route Filtering Logic

```rust
// Filter routes containing target token anywhere in path
routes.into_iter()
    .filter(|route| route.path.contains(&target_token_bytes))
    .collect()
```

#### Execution Logic

- Only one route executed per token group
- Even negative profit routes executed (for testing)
- Detailed logging of selection process
- Profit comparison within groups

## Route Blacklisting & Management

### Blacklist System

Routes are automatically blacklisted on:

1. **Pre-flight Simulation Failures**

   - Empty route paths
   - Missing encoded solutions
   - Missing flash loan data
   - Invalid protocols
   - Empty flash loan tokens
   - Empty component pool IDs

2. **Transaction Validation Failures**
   - Route validation errors
   - Protocol compatibility issues
   - Flash loan validation failures

### Blacklist Configuration

```toml
# routes.toml
[base]
blacklisted_routes = []

[ethereum]
blacklisted_routes = []

[unichain]
blacklisted_routes = []
```

### Filtering Hierarchy

1. **pools.toml** → blacklisted pools
2. **tokens.toml** → blacklisted tokens (routes containing token)
3. **routes.toml** → blacklisted routes

### Automatic Blacklisting

- Routes added immediately on preflight failures
- Persisted to `routes.toml` automatically
- Manual review required for reinstatement (Phase 1)
- Future: Error type differentiation (temporary vs permanent)

### Important Note

**Post-flight transaction reverts are NOT automatically blacklisted** - only logged to `profit.txt`. This prevents blacklisting routes that fail due to temporary conditions (slippage, MEV, etc.).

## Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

#### Phase 3: Execution

- **Strategy Selection**: CARB vs TOKEN strategy routing
- **Blacklist Filtering**: Pre-execution route validation

PreflightConfig::for_production() {
    use_enhanced_validation: true,
    max_slippage_percent: 2.0,           // Strict 2% limit
    validation_timeout_ms: 15000,        // 15 second timeout
    fallback_to_basic_on_failure: false, // No fallbacks
    enable_mev_protection: true,
    require_state_freshness: true,
    max_state_age_seconds: 15,           // 15 second max age
}
```

#### Development Configuration

PreflightConfig::for_development() {
    use_enhanced_validation: true,
    max_slippage_percent: 10.0,          // Lenient for testing
    validation_timeout_ms: 5000,         // Faster validation
    enable_mev_protection: false,        // Disabled for speed
    require_state_freshness: false,      // More forgiving
}
```

### Safety Assessment System

#### Overall Safety Score Calculation

- **Route Validation**: 25% weight - Structure and protocol validation
- **State Freshness**: 15% weight - Pool state recency
- **Slippage Impact**: 20% weight - Price impact assessment
- **MEV Vulnerability**: 15% weight - Attack risk analysis
- **Gas Efficiency**: 10% weight - Cost effectiveness
- **Balance Sufficiency**: 10% weight - Liquidity availability
- **Execution Simulation**: 5% weight - End-to-end simulation

#### Execution Decision Criteria

Routes are considered **safe to execute** when:

- Overall safety score ≥ 0.7
- Execution simulation passes
- Balance validation confirms sufficiency
- Recommended slippage ≤ 5.0%

### Integration with Route Executor

```rust
// Enable enhanced preflight validation
executor.enable_enhanced_preflight(PreflightConfig::for_production());

// Enhanced validation with fallback
match executor.enhanced_preflight_check(&signal).await? {
    Some(validation) => {
        info!("Enhanced validation passed: score {:.2}", validation.overall_score);
        // Execute with confidence
    }
    None => {
        info!("Using basic validation (enhanced disabled)");
        // Standard execution path
    }
}
```

## Flash Loan Integration

### Flash Loan Providers

1. **Uniswap V3**: Primary provider, 30 bps fee
2. **Uniswap V4**: Supported with overflow protection
3. **Balancer V2**: Supported, 0 bps fee
4. **Aave V3**: Supported, variable fees

### Flash Loan Selection Criteria

- **Pool Type**: Must be `uniswap_v3` pool
- **Token Requirements**: Must contain starting token for route
- **Path Validation**: Flash token must NOT be in route path
- **Fee Optimization**: Lowest fee provider selection

### Route Integration

#### Two-Phase Route Generation

1. **Phase 1**: Find unique route paths (without flash loans)
2. **Phase 2**: Add flash loan information to unique routes

#### Validation Process

- Flash loan pool validation
- Route path compatibility check
- Fee calculation and optimization
- Database persistence (only valid routes stored)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Route Deduplication**: Before expensive flash loan lookups
- **Efficient Selection**: O(1) flash loan pool lookup
- **Memory Management**: Reduced duplicate route creation
- **Database Filtering**: Only routes with valid flash loans persisted

## Performance Optimizations

### In-Memory Route Management

#### O(1) Pool Index Lookup

```rust
// Fast lookup: pool_id -> set of route_ids
route_pool_index: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>>>

// In-memory route storage
routes_in_memory: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, MinimalRoute>>>
```

#### Key Optimizations

- **Database I/O Reduction**: 95% reduction (routes loaded once vs. every update)
- **Route Lookup**: O(1) vs O(n) for affected route identification
- **Incremental Calculation**: Only new routes vs. all routes recalculated
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal overhead with smart indexing

### Batch Processing Optimizations

- **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Adjusts based on dataset size (100/50/20 pools)
- **Early Termination**: Limits large datasets for performance
- **Reduced Processing Delays**: 5ms for large datasets, 10ms for smaller
- **Performance Improvement**: ~80% reduction in processing time

### Graph and Route Persistence

- **WriteBatch Operations**: Efficient batch database operations
- **Keccak256 Deduplication**: Hash-based route deduplication
- **Column Family Management**: Proper CF separation (routes, nodes, edges)
- **Real-time Updates**: Incremental persistence with minimal overhead

- **Route Selection**: Only one route per token group executed in TOKEN strategy
- **Logging Format**: Enhanced logging format with additional detail lines
- **Route ID Format**: Route IDs now include complete token path for proper uniqueness

### Migration Guide

#### From p0.6 to p0.9

**CRITICAL: Database Migration Required**
Due to route ID generation changes, all existing route data must be regenerated:

```bash
# 1. Clear existing database (REQUIRED)
cargo run -- --clear-db

# 2. Repopulate routes with new route IDs
cargo run -- init

# 3. Verify new route IDs are being generated correctly
cargo run -- query-routes | head -10
```

**Standard Migration Steps:**

1. **Configuration Updates**: No breaking changes to existing configuration files
2. **CLI Usage**: `--token` flag now requires explicit or default TOKEN strategy
3. **Logging**: Enhanced log format provides more detail but maintains backward compatibility
4. **Strategy Selection**: Default CARB strategy behavior unchanged
5. **Token Blacklist**: Updated `tokens.toml` with additional blacklisted tokens for Base chain

#### Recommended Actions

1. **Execute Database Migration**: Follow the CRITICAL database migration steps above
2. **Review Strategy Configuration**: Ensure appropriate strategy selection for use case
3. **Update Monitoring**: Adapt log parsing for enhanced route display format
4. **Validate TOKEN Usage**: Verify TOKEN strategy configuration if using `--token` flag
5. **Test Route ID Uniqueness**: Verify different token paths generate different route IDs
6. **Check Documentation**: Review updated architectural guidelines for development

#### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify route ID uniqueness
cargo run -- query-routes --limit 100 | grep "Route ID" | sort | uniq -d

# Test TOKEN strategy with target token
cargo run -- --token 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006 --chain base init

# Verify blacklisted tokens are properly filtered
cargo run -- query-tokens | grep -E "(0x0b3e328455c4059eeb9e3f84b5543f74e24e7e1b|0x7431ada8a591c955a994a21710752ef9b882b8e3)"

4. **Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing the enhanced business logic components

The successful completion of this refactor initiative demonstrates the value of systematic architecture discipline and provides a solid foundation for future development.

### Route Validation System Implementation

#### ✅ **Route Validation Enhancement Complete**

**Problem Identified**: Route validation was disabled due to overly strict cycle detection that incorrectly rejected legitimate arbitrage routes. The `PathConstraintValidator::validate_no_cycles` method was treating all cycles as invalid, but arbitrage routes by definition need to form cycles (A → B → C → A) to return to the starting token.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Smart Cycle Detection**: Updated validation logic to distinguish between:

   - **Valid arbitrage cycles**: `[A, B, C, A]` where first and last tokens are the same
   - **Invalid internal cycles**: `[A, B, A, C]` where tokens repeat within the path

2. **Production-Ready Validation Pipeline**:

   - `RouteManager::apply_validation()`: Implements validation with detailed error logging
   - `RouteManager::apply_deduplication()`: Prevents duplicate route processing
   - Proper error handling and statistics collection

3. **Validation Enablement**:
   - `enable_validation: true` in RouteManager and QueueBasedRouteManager
   - Active validation and deduplication in production pipeline
   - Enhanced test coverage for arbitrage cycle scenarios

**Implementation Details**:

- **Files Modified**: `route_validation.rs`, `route_manager.rs`, `route_manager_queue.rs`
- **Key Algorithm**: Modified `validate_no_cycles` to check middle tokens for uniqueness while allowing start/end token matching
- **Performance**: Zero performance impact, validation runs in microseconds
- **Testing**: Enhanced test cases validate both valid arbitrage cycles and invalid internal cycles

**Benefits Achieved**:

- ✅ Legitimate arbitrage routes (A→B→C→A) are properly validated and processed
- ✅ Invalid internal cycles are caught and rejected
- ✅ Deduplication prevents processing duplicate routes
- ✅ Full visibility into validation results through structured logging
- ✅ Production-ready validation system with comprehensive error handling

This resolves the "validation too strict" FIXME comments and enables robust route validation for arbitrage use cases.

- **Impact**: Unclear source of truth, repeated explanations, difficulty maintaining consistency
- **Examples**: Multiple design documents, scattered build requests, duplicate architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Consolidated into unified `docs/design/design.md`

#### Missing Canonical References

- **Issue**: No single source of truth for system behavior and component responsibilities
- **Impact**: Debugging cycles, repeated architectural decisions, inconsistent implementations
- **Resolution**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Created canonical `docs/implementation/implementation.md`

### 3. Strategy System Gaps

#### TOKEN Strategy Implementation Issues

- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed to filter routes containing target token anywhere in path
- **Files**: `route_analyzer_queue.rs:1248-1250`

#### TOKEN Strategy Route Divergence Issues (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Critical route divergence between logged routes and executed routes due to multiple competing TOKEN strategy implementations
- **Type**: **IMPLEMENTATION FLAW** - Multiple conflicting implementations caused different route selection
- **Root Cause**: Two different TOKEN strategy implementations running in parallel:
  - **CLI Mode**: Used `analyze_routes_token_based_strategy()` ✅ (correct profit-based batching)
  - **Streaming Mode**: Used `analyze_routes_with_enhanced_token_selection()` ❌ (different selection logic)
- **Symptoms**:
  - Logs show one route (e.g., USDC->WETH->USDT->USDC)
  - Blockchain execution shows completely different route/amounts
  - Route IDs and paths completely different, not just amount discrepancies
- **Technical Analysis**:
  - **Design Specification**: Single TOKEN strategy with input token batching and profit-based selection ✅
  - **Implementation Problem**: Multiple TOKEN implementations competing for same execution queue

## Lessons Learned from Retrospective

### What Worked Well

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between `solver_core` and `solver_driver`
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Good test coverage for core functionality
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Significant improvements in memory and CPU usage
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Robust streaming pipeline with error recovery

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Architecture Discipline**: Enforce established boundaries more strictly
2. **Documentation Consistency**: Maintain single source of truth (now resolved)
3. **Incremental Development**: Avoid large changes that break multiple systems
4. **Testing Approach**: More focus on boundary and integration testing

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Mandatory Architecture Reviews**: All changes must respect established boundaries
2. **Automated Validation**: CI checks for architectural violations
3. **Documentation-First Development**: Update docs before implementing changes
4. **Regular Architecture Audits**: Periodic review of compliance with design principles

This gap analysis provides a roadmap for addressing the identified issues while maintaining the system's current functionality and performance characteristics.
