# 1inch

## Overview

1inch is a DEX aggregator that sources liquidity from various exchanges to offer users better token swap rates. Our solver infrastructure provides comprehensive support for 1inch's intent-based protocols, including limit order solving and liquidity aggregation integration.

## Using our Solution

Our 1inch solver integration enables:

- **Limit Order Solving**: Participate in 1inch's limit order protocol for competitive order filling
- **Liquidity Aggregation**: Integrate with 1inch's aggregation routing for optimal execution
- **Cross-protocol Optimization**: Combine 1inch routes with our multi-protocol infrastructure
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor and solve 1inch limit orders with microsecond-level evaluation
- **Capital Efficiency**: Execute orders using flash loans without inventory requirements

## Solution Overview

The 1inch solver integration leverages our high-performance solving infrastructure to participate in 1inch's ecosystem as both a limit order solver and liquidity provider. The system can process 1inch limit orders and integrate 1inch's aggregation routes into our broader routing optimization.

### 1inch Protocol Integration

#### Limit Order Protocol
1inch's Limit Order Protocol enables gasless limit orders with flexible execution conditions:

1. **Order Creation**: Users create limit orders with specific price and time constraints
2. **Solver Competition**: Solvers compete to fill orders at favorable prices
3. **Partial Fills**: Support for partial order execution over time
4. **Advanced Conditions**: Complex conditional logic for order execution

#### Aggregation Protocol
1inch's aggregation protocol finds optimal routes across multiple DEXs:

1. **Route Discovery**: Find best prices across supported protocols
2. **Split Routing**: Split large orders across multiple protocols
3. **Gas Optimization**: Minimize total execution costs including gas
4. **Slippage Protection**: Built-in protection against unfavorable price movements

### Architecture Integration

Our solver infrastructure integrates with 1inch through several key components:

#### Order Monitoring
- **Limit Order Streaming**: Real-time monitoring of new 1inch limit orders
- **Order Filtering**: Filter orders based on profitability and execution constraints
- **Market Monitoring**: Track market conditions for optimal filling opportunities

#### Route Integration
- **1inch Route Inclusion**: Include 1inch aggregation routes in our routing optimization
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare 1inch routes against our native route discovery
- **Hybrid Execution**: Combine 1inch routes with direct protocol access

#### Solution Generation
- **Order Filling Strategies**: Develop optimal strategies for limit order execution
- **Price Improvement**: Provide better execution than quoted limit prices
- **Batch Optimization**: Fill multiple orders efficiently in single transactions

            let solution = self.create_solution(&order, &route).await?;

            Ok(solution)
        } else {
            Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Order not profitable"))
        }
    }

    pub async fn integrate_aggregation_route(
        &self,
        from_token: Address,
        to_token: Address,
        amount: U256,
    ) -> Result<Route> {
        // Get 1inch aggregation quote
        let inch_quote = self.aggregation_client.get_quote(
            from_token,
            to_token,
            amount,
        ).await?;

        // Compare with our native routes
        let native_route = self.route_analyzer.find_best_route(
            from_token,
            to_token,
            amount,
        ).await?;

        // Return best option
        if inch_quote.output_amount > native_route.output_amount {
            Ok(inch_quote.to_route())
        } else {

    // Execute with flash loan if needed
    let tx = if route.requires_capital {
        self.execute_with_flash_loan(order, &route).await?
