# Solver System Design Document - Phase 2.0

## Abstract

Phase 2.0 represents the culmination of the solver evolution, transforming the system into a fully decentralized protocol with autonomous governance, tokenized incentives, and community-driven development. This release establishes the solver ecosystem as an independent protocol with decentralized governance, sustainable tokenomics, and comprehensive ecosystem expansion capabilities.
