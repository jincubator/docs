## Overview

Jincubator is a research incubator.

At at July 2025 the research has primarily lead by [John Whitton](https://johnwhitton.com) with collaboration from organizations such as Uniswap and Harmony. This work has been self funded with limited funds being received from Hackathon prizes.

If you are interested in collaborating with Jincubator, please reach out to [team@jincubator.com](mailto:team@jincubator.com) or directly to [john@johnwhitton.com](mailto:john@johnwhitton.com)

## Goals

Jincubator goals are as follows

- Continue to develop research and engineering skills by researching and building on the cutting edge products and protocols.
- Contribute research, design and technical solutions to the Crypto industry
- Productize research into DeFi protocols or infrastructure.

## Collaborate

Here are some ways to Partner with Jincubator

### Funding through Bounties or Grants

Rather than seeking angel funding or raising through a Token Generation Event. We have been building and iterating to ensure product fit and are now looking for funding via grants or bounties to continue this work. Preferred grants would come from technical providers such as Tycho and Uniswap which we are building on. Also Solvers, Blockchains and Protocols looking to integrate with Tycho.

We are currently building on Tycho and looking at continuing work on arbitrage, developing Solvers(Fillers) for CompactX, UniswapX, CowSwap and 1Inch.

The potential areas which we are looking to incorporate into a revenue positive platform include

#### No Liquidity Solving

An opinionated architecture, built on Tycho, for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the Swapper's locked funds for execution. For protocol architecture and technical design please see [https://jincubator.com](https://jincubator.com)

#### Solver

Building out Tycho based Solvers starting with the following protocols

- CompactX: An expansive locking system from [the-compact](https://github.com/jincubator/the-compact/). We have incorporated [Mandates and Solver Payloads](https://www.jincubator.com/design/protocol) to allow Intents to be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution. _As of July 25th the [the-compact](https://github.com/jincubator/the-compact/) we are developing on has been forked from [Uniswap the-compact](https://github.com/Uniswap/the-compact/tree/v1) v1 branch which has not as yet been deployed._
- UniswapX: I attended Uniswap's Hook Incubator course and have been in touch with Alumni as I build in this area. I plan to start work on a Uniswap Solver in August.
- CowSwap: I have done some original evaluation of CowSwap Solving, building and running a CowSwap Solver locally built from the [services](https://github.com/cowprotocol/services) repository.
- 1Inch: I am spent the week of July 28th working on the [Expanding Limit Order track](https://ethglobal.com/events/unite/prizes). With the goal of improving my knowledge of 1inch and becoming well positioned to become a Filler and potentially integrate some of the research done in Jincubator for more efficient solving. Here is our project page, design, [deck](https://unite-deck.jincubator.com) and [video](https://unite-video.jincubator.com) explaining the vision of no liquidity solving.

#### Arbitrage

I have begun development of an Arbitrage bot. It uses Tycho's indexing simulation and execution modules. It uses a variation of the [Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) to find revenue positive arbitrage cycles. It aligns with the foundational requirement for an atomic arbitrage solver as specified in [Tycho Application Proposal 4](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-x/blob/main/TAP-4.md) once this foundation is in place the infrastructure can be expanded into Cross Chain Arbitrage and Market Making.

#### Previous Grant applications

- [Tycho Atomic Arbitrage](https://hackmd.io/@jincubator/atomic-arbitrage): An arbitrage bot built on Tycho's indexing simulation and execution modules. It uses a variation of the [Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) to find revenue positive arbitrage cycles.
- [Sunrise Protocol (Polkadot 2020)](https://hackmd.io/@jincubator/sunrise): Sunrise was building a decentralized protocol on a dedicated Polkadot parachain.

### Consulting

Currently, [John Whitton](https://johnwhitton.com) is interested in consulting in the following areas.

#### DEX Integrations

I am familiar with the key Tycho Repositories (Indexing, Simulation, Execution and the SDK) and am experienced in Protocol Design (Soldity) and Service Development(Rust). I have also run consulting firms and managed teams of engineers. I would enjoy partnering with Tycho to help bring on additional Protocols to the platform.

#### Chain Integrations and Rollup Providers

Similar to above I have done extensive research on Chains, consensus designs and building Rollouts. I would enjoy partnering with Tycho to help bring on additional chains. I also can drive conversations with Layer 2 Rollup providers such as Caldera and Conduit about how to include Tycho natively in their rollup offerings.

#### Infrastructure Partnerships

I have lead teams building out Layer 1 platforms and DeFi protocols and worked as an Ecosystem Architect. I'm also familiar with researching partner technologies. I did some initial work with EigenLayers [dev-kit-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli) and [rust integration](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hello-world-avs?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-rust). They are active in the community and may be worth evaluating as a partner for some of Tycho's services. I would need to think about this more.
