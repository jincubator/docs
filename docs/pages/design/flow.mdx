# IntentSwap

### IntentSwap Flow

1. Swapper(via CompactX) calls Quoter (Callibrator, SmartOrderRouter)
2. Quoter returns Output Tokens for Swap
3. Swapper Agrees on Swap and
   a. Calls Disseminator which stores all Compact Information and Creates IntentSwapHash
   b. calls Intent Manager to create SwapIntent (more callData and would use EventData to publish to Solvers)
4. Intent Manager(Sponsor) formats Compact, Mandate data and Signature
5. IntentManager(Sponsor) calls Allocator to create a compact
6. Allocator creates a compact locking the funds
7. Allocator creates a claim emitting an event that can be processed by Solvers
8. Solver determines the optimal route (using Tycho Simulation)
9. Solver creates a SolverPayload containing the callData for the Transactions to be executed
10. Solver calls the Arbiter to Execute the Payload and Unlock the Funds
11. Arbiter receives the IntentSwapSolve
12. Aribiter request approval to use the IntentSwaps InputTokens for the-compact via the Allocator
13. Arbiter executes the Solve on behalf of the Solver
    a. using the SolverPayload
    b. Executing via the dispatcher
    c. Using the allocated input tokens
14. Arbiter then checks if the Amount of Output Tokens satisfies the mandate
15. If the Output Tokens are less than the mandate then reverts STOP
16. Arbiter sends a signed message to the Allocator to close the compact
    a. Any unused input tokens are returned to the Sponsor.
    b. Output Tokens are returned to the Solver

## Usage (Flows by Actor)

The Compact V1 facilitates interactions between several key actors. Here's how typical participants might use the system.

### Sponsors (Depositors)

Sponsors own the underlying assets and create resource locks to make them available under specific conditions.

**1. Create a Resource Lock (Deposit Tokens):** - A sponsor starts by depositing assets (native tokens or ERC20s) into The Compact. This action creates ERC6909 tokens representing ownership of the resource lock. - During deposit, the sponsor defines the lock's properties: the **allocator** (who must be registered first, see [Allocators (Infrastructure)](#allocators-infrastructure), the **scope** (single-chain or multichain), and the **reset period** (for forced withdrawals and emissary replacements). These are packed into a `bytes12 lockTag`. A resource lock's ID is a combination of its lock tag and the underlying token's address. - Deposit methods: - Native tokens: `depositNative` - ERC20 tokens (requires direct approval): `depositERC20`- Batch deposits (native + ERC20): `batchDeposit` - Via Permit2 (optionally gasless): `depositERC20ViaPermit2`, `batchDepositViaPermit2`

**2. Create a Compact:** - To make locked funds available for claiming, a sponsor creates a compact, defining terms and designating an **arbiter**.

- **Option A: Signing an EIP-712 Payload:** The sponsor signs a `Compact`, `BatchCompact`, or `MultichainCompact` payload. This signed payload is given to the arbiter.
- **Option B: Registering the Compact:** The sponsor (or a third party with an existing sponsor signature) registers the _hash_ of the intended compact details using `register` or combined deposit-and-register functions. It is also possible to deposit tokens on behalf of a sponsor and register a compact using only the deposited tokens without the sponsor's signature using the `depositAndRegisterFor` (or the batch and permit2 variants).

**3. (Optional) Transfer Resource Lock Ownership:** - Sponsors can transfer their ERC6909 tokens, provided they have authorization from the allocator. - Standard ERC6909 transfers require allocator `attest`. - Alternatively, use `allocatedTransfer` or `allocatedBatchTransfer` with explicit `allocatorData`.

**4. (Optional) Assign an Emissary:** - Designate an `IEmissary` using `assignEmissary` as a fallback authorizer.

**5. (Optional) Initiate Forced Withdrawal:** - If an allocator is unresponsive, use `enableForcedWithdrawal`, wait `resetPeriod`, then `forcedWithdrawal`.

### Arbiters & Claimants (e.g. Fillers)

Arbiters verify conditions and process claims. Claimants are the recipients.

**1. Receive Compact Details:** - Obtain compact details (signed payload or registered compact info).

**2. Fulfill Compact Conditions:** - Perform the action defined by the compact (often off-chain).

**3. Obtain Allocator Authorization:** - This relies on the allocator's on-chain `authorizeClaim` logic. Note that the arbiter may submit `allocatorData` (i.e., an allocator's signature or other proof the allocator understands) which the allocator can evaluate as part of its authorization flow.

**4. Submit the Claim:** - Call the appropriate claim function on `ITheCompactClaims` with the claim payload (e.g., `Claim`, `BatchClaim`). - The payload includes `allocatorData`, `sponsorSignature` (if not registered), lock details, and `claimants` array. Successful execution emits a `Claim` event and consumes the nonce.

### Relayers

Relayers can perform certain interactions on behalf of sponsors and/or claimants.

**1. Relaying Permit2 Interactions:** - Submit user-signed Permit2 messages for deposits/registrations (e.g., `depositERC20ViaPermit2`, `depositERC20AndRegisterViaPermit2`, or the batch variants). For the register variants, this role is called the `Activator` and the registration is authorized by the sponsor as part of the Permit2 witness data.

**2. Relaying Registrations-for-Sponsor:** - Submit sponsor-signed registration details using `registerFor` functions.

**3. Relaying Claims:** - Submit authorized claims on behalf of a claimant using the standard `claim` functions. This would generally be performed by the arbiter of the claim being relayed.

### Allocators (Infrastructure)

Allocators are crucial infrastructure for ensuring resource lock integrity.

**1. Registration:** - Register via `__registerAllocator` to get an `allocatorId`. This is a required step that must be performed before the allocator may be assigned to a resource lock. Anyone can register an allocator if one of three conditions is met: the caller is the allocator address being registered; the allocator address contains code; or a proof is supplied representing valid create2 deployment parameters.

**Create2 Proof Format**: When registering an allocator that doesn't yet exist but will be deployed via create2, provide an 85-byte proof containing: `0xff ++ factory ++ salt ++ initcode hash`. This allows pre-registration of deterministic addresses.

**2. Implement `IAllocator` Interface:** - Deploy a contract implementing `IAllocator`. - `attest`: Called during ERC6909 transfers. Must verify safety and return `IAllocator.attest.selector`. - `authorizeClaim` / `isClaimAuthorized`: Core logic to validate claims against sponsor balances and nonces. `authorizeClaim` returns `IAllocator.authorizeClaim.selector` for on-chain validation.

**3. (Optional) Off-chain Logic / `allocatorData` Generation:** - Allocators may have off-chain systems that track balances, validate requests, generate `allocatorData` (e.g., signatures), and/or manage nonces. - The Compact is unopinionated about the particulars of allocator implementations. - Two basic sample implementations have been provided: [Smallocator](https://github.com/uniswap/smallocator) and [Autocator](https://github.com/uniswap/autocator).

**4. (Optional) Consuming Nonces:** - Proactively invalidate compacts using `consume` on The Compact contract.
