- [Proposals](/proposals/intro): Welcome to the Jincubator Research Hub.
- [Research Proposal: Solvers, Arbitrage & Intent-Based Protocols](/proposals/solving-arbitrage): Over the past eight months, Iâ€™ve developed both a solver engine and an intent-based swap protocol integrating Uniswap v4. My work spans arbitrage detection/execution, real-time streaming, solver frameworks, and resource-efficient intent mechanisms. Current implementations and documentation are accessible via [jincubator.com/research](https://www.jincubator.com/research).

- [Overview](/research/Intents/architecture): This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and mult-chain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may used the swappers locked funds for execution.
- [IntentSwap](/research/Intents/flow): Swapper(via CompactX) calls Quoter (Callibrator, SmartOrderRouter)
- [Uniswap V4 Hook Development - WIP](/research/Intents/hooks): This section documents design work to be done for enhancing Uniswap V4 through the use of hooks for better price discovery, swapping and solver execution.
- [Solving and Arbitrage Research](/research/Intents/intro): Work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Development can be found in the github organization [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator).
- [Protocol](/research/Intents/protocol): The Protocol is part of an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution. It does this by introducing a SolverPayload which can be executed by the Arbiter to ensure the EIP-712 signed mandate is met.
- [Resource Management](/research/Intents/resources): The Protocol leverages an expansive locking system from [the-compact](https://github.com/jincubator/the-compact/). We have incorporated [Mandates and Solver Payloads](./protocol) to allow Intents to be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution.

- [High Performance Route Evaluation](/research/solving/arbitrager): Below is a reference architecture for a highly performant route evaluation system which can be leveraged to execute advanced solving, arbitrage and market making strategies.
- [Appendices](/research/solving/arbitrager): Note: At the time of writing the performance numbers are still a WIP. We have executed over 800 route evaluations per second and are currently implementing a metrics capturing system to provide more granular performance breakdown.
- [Uniswap V4 Intent Hook](/research/solving/intent-management-hook): This project was an exploration into the use of hooks for intent based solving.
The goal was to implement an intent based hook, that would allow a pool to receive swaps, publish them to a solver network to find the best price for the swap. If a solver returned a more profitable swap (for the swapper) the intent would be executed, the swapper would receive a better return than the pool could offer and the solver would claim the funds. If after the deadline (usually 1 to 2 blocks) no solution with a better return has been provided. Then the swap would be executed as normal upon the pool.
- [NEAR FUSION+ Smart Contract Development](/research/solving/near): NEAR Fusion+ is a comprehensive DeFi protocol that migrates 1inch's proven Limit Order Protocol and Cross-Chain Swap functionality to the NEAR blockchain. The system provides two primary capabilities: advanced limit order trading with partial fills and extensible features, and atomic cross-chain swaps secured by time-locked escrow contracts.
