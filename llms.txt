The system implements a flexible strategy framework that enables market makers and solvers to deploy sophisticated trading algorithms with real-time profitability analysis and execution.
- [Overview](/research/Intents/architecture): This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and mult-chain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may used the swappers locked funds for execution.
- [IntentSwap](/research/Intents/flow): Swapper(via CompactX) calls Quoter (Callibrator, SmartOrderRouter)
- [Uniswap V4 Hook Development - WIP](/research/Intents/hooks): This section documents design work to be done for enhancing Uniswap V4 through the use of hooks for better price discovery, swapping and solver execution.
- [Solving and Arbitrage Research](/research/Intents/intro): Work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). Development can be found in the github organization [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator).
- [Protocol](/research/Intents/protocol): The Protocol is part of an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution. It does this by introducing a SolverPayload which can be executed by the Arbiter to ensure the EIP-712 signed mandate is met.
- [Resource Management](/research/Intents/resources): The Protocol leverages an expansive locking system from [the-compact](https://github.com/jincubator/the-compact/). We have incorporated [Mandates and Solver Payloads](./protocol) to allow Intents to be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution.

- [Uniswap V4 Intent Hook](/research/solving/intent-management-hook): This project was an exploration into the use of hooks for intent based solving.
The goal was to implement an intent based hook, that would allow a pool to receive swaps, publish them to a solver network to find the best price for the swap. If a solver returned a more profitable swap (for the swapper) the intent would be executed, the swapper would receive a better return than the pool could offer and the solver would claim the funds. If after the deadline (usually 1 to 2 blocks) no solution with a better return has been provided. Then the swap would be executed as normal upon the pool.
