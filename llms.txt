- [Solving and Arbitrage Research](/overview): Here you'll find my work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). As of July 2025 I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.
- [Overview](/design/architecture): This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and mult-chain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may used the swappers locked funds for execution.
